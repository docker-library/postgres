#
#  1. (most importantly) as an example of how to use "docker-entrypoint.sh" to extend/reuse the initialization behavior
#
#  2. ("docker-ensure-initdb.sh") as a Kubernetes "init container" to ensure the provided database directory is initialized; see also "startup probes" for an alternative solution
#       (no-op if database is already initialized)
#
#  3. ("docker-enforce-initdb.sh") as part of CI to ensure the database is fully initialized before use
#       (error if database is already initialized)
